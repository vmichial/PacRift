This is a test file.

Below is the test map. Modify with real values, so we can actually test it.

Currently the extension will be TXT, but I think we should make a custom extension because its cooler. like filename.DJPCMASTA or something.

{ #Map Begin
	@Custom Map 1@ #text surrounded by @ symbols is the map name. should only appear once in the code, but if it appears more than once, will use the last instance as the name. Can be alpha-numeric. 
	cubeA: 1;1;1; # Hopefully a list of actual available prefab names will be included with the binary package, so people can make their own maps
	cubeB: 100;100;100;
	cubeC: 75;75;75; %25x
	
	#This is a comment
	
	spawnG: 25;25;25; #Must have 4 Ghost spawns and 1-3 Pac spawns
	& |;|;|; # the & repeats the last prefab name and the | repeats the last coordinates (X, Y and Z are saved)
	& |;|;|;
	& |;|;|;
	
	spawnP: 50;50;50;
	& |;|;|;
	& |;|;|;
} #Map End
